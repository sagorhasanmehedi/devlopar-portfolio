            <p>You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But nobody pays me a dime for that

                That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web

            <p>I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. I can even teach my grandma how

                make
                simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.</p>

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
